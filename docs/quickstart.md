## Development
To set up a development copy of CDIPpy, install the project form source using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):  
``` bash
>>> pip install uv
>>> uv venv
>>> source activate .venv/bin/activate
>>> uv pip install -e .[dev]
```
This creates a local, virtual environment at `./.venv`, and installs a version of CDIPpy that is editable (`-e`), along with several additional dev dependencies (`[dev]`).

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome and should be merged via pull request on the `main` branch from a forked repository. Before a PR can be merged, it needs to pass the following checks:

* all tests passed
* coverage >= threshhold
* passes [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter
* there must be at least one reviewer approval
* a CLA must be signed by the contributor, if this is their first commit

If you do not wish you manually check the style for every commit, there is a pre-commit hook that can do it for you. After setting up CDIPpy for development, install the hook with: `pre-commit install`. The installed hook will auto-format the files in your commit with [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and checked for any remaining format errors with `flake8`.
